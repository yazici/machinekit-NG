This Debian packaging must first be configured before building.

By default, all threads are disabled; package builders MUST enable
thread package builds by adding flags to the debian/configure command
line.  See `debian/configure -h` for details.

eg.

cd to the root dir of the repo

debian/configure -p -r  ( configure for posix and rt-preempt )

debian/rules

DEBIAN_KERNEL_JOBS=${nproc} fakeroot debian/rules binary
